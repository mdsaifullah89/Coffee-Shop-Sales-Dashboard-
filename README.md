Overview of Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard
​1. Introduction and Objectives:
The Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard serves as a strategic analytical tool designed to monitor and optimize the performance of a multi-location coffee retail business. Its primary objective is to provide a granular view of sales trends, customer behavior, and operational efficiency across three key locations: Astoria, Hell's Kitchen, and Lower Manhattan. By visualizing complex datasets, it enables stakeholders to make data-driven decisions regarding inventory, staffing, and marketing.
​2. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
The dashboard prominently displays four critical metrics that define the health of the business:
​Total Revenue: The shop generated a significant total revenue of approximately \$698,812.33.
​Transaction Volume: A total of 149,116 transactions were recorded, reflecting a high customer footfall.
​Total Quantity Sold: The business moved 214,470 units of products.
​Average Transaction Value (ATV): The average spend per customer stands at \$4.69, a vital metric for understanding pricing strategy and upselling effectiveness.
​3. Store-Wise Performance and Distribution:
The data reveals a remarkably balanced performance across all three branches. Astoria, Hell's Kitchen, and Lower Manhattan each contribute roughly 33\% to the total revenue and transaction count. This uniformity suggests consistent brand strength and demand across different urban localities, with Lower Manhattan showing a marginal lead in transaction quantity (71,742 units).
​4. Product Category Analysis:
Revenue is categorized into several segments, with Coffee being the dominant driver at 38.6\%, followed by Tea at 28.1\%. Other significant contributors include Bakery (11.8\%) and Drinking Chocolate (10.4\%). Specific high-performing products include Barista Espresso, Brewed Chai Tea, and Gourmet Brewed Coffee.
​5. Temporal Trends and Insights:
The dashboard highlights peak operational hours, showing a steady climb in transactions from 07:00 AM (19,449) to a peak at 10:00 AM (26,713), followed by a decline by 11:00 AM. Daily analysis shows stable revenue streams across weekdays, particularly on Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays.
